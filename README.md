# HJA-streams: Environmental samples from H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon

This repository contains data and code for a survey of bacterial diversity across two watersheds in the [H.J. Andrews (HJA) Experimental Forest](http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/), an [NSF-LTER](http://www.lternet.edu/) site located in Oregon, USA. 

**Site description:** In HJA, experimental Watershed 1 (WS01) is nested within the broader Lookout Creek catchment [[site map](http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/about/images/newbase2011.jpg)]. Both watersheds have similar network topography, but vary in their spatial extent and micro-habitat diversity. Lookout Creek (LC) spans the whole forest and drains two peaks (Carpenter Mtn. and Lookout Mtn.), 10 small watersheds, and many other lateral tributary inputs.

## Project Goals
This ongoing project is part of Nathan Wisnoski's dissertation research.

**Aim 1**: Characterize the major drivers of microbial metacommunity structure of surface waters and sediments in stream networks across HJA. 

**Aim 2**: Understand how the importance of these drivers changes with spatial extent.

**Aim 3**: Explore the ecological processes and physical/hydrological constraints governing microbial community assembly in sediment biofilms.

## Repo Contents
This respository currently contains the following folders:

* `./data/` : This folder contains data from a spring 2015 trip to HJA.
* `./analysis/` : This folder contains scripts that run analyses on files from the `data` folder.
* `./figures/` : This folder contains figure output from analyses.
* `./imagery/` : This folder contains GIS and map images.
