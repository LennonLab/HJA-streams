# HJA-streams: Stream bacterial communities from H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon

This repository contains data and code for a survey of bacterial diversity across two watersheds in the [H.J. Andrews (HJA) Experimental Forest](http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/), an [NSF-LTER](http://www.lternet.edu/) site located in Oregon, USA. 

**Site description:** In HJA, experimental Watershed 1 (WS01) is nested within the broader Lookout Creek catchment [[site map](http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/about/images/newbase2011.jpg)].
